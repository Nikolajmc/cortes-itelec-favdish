        <h1>James Recipe for the best Spanish Bread Rolls</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 packet (21 / 4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>11 / 4 cups warm water (about 110째F / 43째C)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Activate the Yeast:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine the warm water and sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the active dry yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes foamy. This indicates that the yeast is activated.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Prepare the Dough:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.</li>
                <li>Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the activated yeast mixture.</li>
                <li>Add the olive oil to the bowl.</li>
                <li>Mix the ingredients together to form a dough.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Knead the Dough:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead it for about 8-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. You can also use a stand mixer with a dough hook for this step.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>First Rise:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Place the kneaded dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours or until it has doubled in size.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Shape the Rolls:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Punch down the risen dough and divide it into 12 equal portions.</li>
                <li>Shape each portion into a ball or an oval shape, depending on your preference.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Second Rise:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Place the shaped rolls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving some space between them.</li>
                <li>Cover the rolls with a damp cloth and let them rise for another 30-45 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Preheat the Oven:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C) during the last 15 minutes of the second rise.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Bake:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Bake the rolls in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes or until they turn golden brown.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Cool:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow the Spanish bread rolls to cool on a wire rack before serving.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
